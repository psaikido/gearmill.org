_"To realize Mahamudra is really true freedom."_  
( Ven. Lama Chime Rinpoche, 2009 )

Sometimes referred to as 'objectless meditation' or meditation upon awareness, the basic instruction is to rest in clear, present awareness.

_'Tilopa said to Naropa, Naropa said to Marpa, Marpa said to Milarepa, Milarepa said to Gampopa and Gampopa said to everybody, just observe the mind without distraction.'_  
Jetsunma Tenzin Palmo, from Three Teachings. 

Relaxing body, speech and mind, resting in the natural state: 
_'The body is essentially empty like a bamboo stalk, and the mind is like the midst of space and utterly transcends the world of thought: Relax into your intrinsic nature, with neither abandon nor control; mind with no objective is Mahamudra and with practice perfected, unsurpassable awakening is gained.'_  
Tilopa's Mahamudra Instruction.
