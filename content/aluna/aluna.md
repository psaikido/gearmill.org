## Aluna Movement

Mindfulness and Chi Kung practice in daily life

Mindfulness and Chi Kung share in common the cultivation of awareness. Both avenues of practice nurture qualities of calm, insight, and kindness through meditation, in stillness and movement.

Meditation in movement and sitting meditation complement one another. Through grounding and alignment, cultivating balance and harmony – practice leads to deepening union with a wider ‘Eco-body.’ The taste of a vast sacred dance.

Great joy can arise as natural healing presence awakens in the practitioner, and brings resilience. Engendering peaceful embodiment, group practice may become an evolving mandala, which nourishes compassionate community.

‘Aluna is startlingly similar, for example, to the Buddhist concept of Tao, 

the changeless reality which sustains heaven and earth.’

Alan Ereira, ‘The Heart of the World’
