### DEDICATION AND EMPOWERMENT  
### OF THE GREEN TARA STONE  
### OF THE WOODS AND WATERS  
### GEAR MILL, CORNWALL  
We bless this stone with the empowerment of the spirit  
of Green Tara  
May her mantra permeate this temple by the waters,  
inspire those who practise here  
and bring blessings on all those who visit her.


We bless this stone with the empowerment of the spirit  
of Green Tara:  
so that her creation from tears of compassion for the world  
may inspire all likewise taking care of this place and all habitats  
of wild creatures - world wide.


We bless this stone with the empowerment of the spirit  
of Green Tara:  
so that her energies may transform the ill in body  
and the sick in mind  
with the vast spaciousness of the light of bliss inherent  
in the awareness of every moment  
bringing them to a joy irrespective of any condition.


OM TARE TUTTARE TURE SWAHA
