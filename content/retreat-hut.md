## Tara-Ling Retreat Hut

Tara-Ling retreat hut sleeps one person comfortably, and can sleep two. 

Inside is a shrine table, desk and hand-carved wooden 4’ double bed with a small wood-burner. Outside, there is an out-door semi-covered kitchen and a terrace with vine, chairs and table.

The stone hut is next to the woods and stream and is available for full or semi-retreat for between 2 and 7 days. The hut has electricity, and a standpipe for running water behind the outside wall.

There is a composting loo with an out-door wash-stand near to the retreat hut, and guests may use the bathroom in the main house for showers.

There is no wifi and the area is kept smoking, alcohol and noise free for the benefit of everyone staying, maintaining tranquility and a replenishing atmosphere.

Please note there is no mobile signal in the valley, however calls can be made higher up the hill on either side of the creek; there is a land-line available on request.

Dedicated to Tara, female Buddha of Compassion, Tara-Ling means Tara’s Place: the green of the valley echoing Tara’s promise.

Rates for hire of the retreat hut:

Single booking £25 per night

Two people £30 per night
