## History

First established by monks of St Michaelâ€™s Mount at the creek head in 1262, Gear Mill has a long working history, standing by the tidal water of the Helford River, absorbed in its timeless rhythm.

In a beautiful valley situated beside ruins of the higher mills, the New Mill was the last mill to be built in Cornwall in 1922. Forming a natural sanctuary, Gear Mill is now a home and practice centre, hosting meditation groups, daylong and residential retreats.

Although the 30 ft waterwheel is no longer in existence, a wheel of Dharma, community and friendship turns. 

Visitors are warmly welcome to share in the peace and beauty of this ancient place.



"The valley spirit never dies,

it is the primordial Mother from whose gate 

springs the origin of heaven and earth."

_Tao Te Ching chapter 6_
