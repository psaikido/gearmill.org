## About

Gear Mill is a family home with a dedicated shrine room serving as space for meditation, chi kung and healing.

Adjoining the mill is a stone retreat hut, Tara Ling, welcoming guests and those wishing to do retreat in this naturally peaceful valley.

We are glad to share our vision of a place offering space for contemplation, inspiration and renewal.
